# tcp-ip-security
The TCP-IP security project aims to analyse the security of the TCP/IP protocle
## Installation
The installation of the necessary packages is done using the requirements.txt file. We recommend using a local environnement

### local environnement
First ini the v-env if you have not already done so :\
```python -m venv .venv```\
This will create **your** personnal environnement located in a file. This way, it will not break your global python installation. This step needs to be done only once.\
\
Second, activate the environnement : \
```. ./.venv/script/activate```*\
*(might be /bin/activate if you are on linux)\
\
Lastly, you can install your dependency :\
```pip -m install -r requirements.txt```\
its all done ! Enjoy the project.
